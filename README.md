# Perceptron

## A perceptron has 2 calculations to perform
* Dot product (z) of Features (X) with weights (w) (adding bias)
* Applying Activation function (a) to the Dot Product

## Their are different choices for Activation functions
* Sigmoid
* Hyperbolic tangent
* Relu (Relu and its variants)

## It is the Activation function that will fit the model to data
* Boundary line for simple linear problems
* Curves for non linear problems
* Squiggles for complex non linear problems

# Multi Layer Perceptron
In order to solve real world problems, we need different permutations and combinations of **Perceptron**, which results in MLP
MLP is the building block of complex Artificial Neural Network
